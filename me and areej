        <p>Hey beautiful, I'm so glad it's been six beautiful months. Every day and moment has felt like a blessing since I've been with you. Every up and down, and even when we don't talk, stuff was super confusing and magical when we started dating. I know we started off as crazy, but I love that crazy. It felt like a fairy tale being in Vegas with you, those nights staying up at Starbucks and talking, telling you everything about myself. It made me fall so in love; it was so magical and gave me butterflies in my stomach.</p>
        <p>I love you so much, gorgeous girl. <span class="heart">❤️</span></p>
        <p class="banner">Areej, will you have dinner with me on Friday the 14th at 6 PM Utah time?</p>
